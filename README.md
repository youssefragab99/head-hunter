*Goals for this repo*

Create an automated way of evaluating how well a resume matches a certain job description to figure out if the candidate is a good fit for the position. We will use chat-gpt to evaluate both the resume and the job description, the goal is to output a report with the following information:
1- How well does the resume match the job description
2- Key words from the job description that can help the candidate pass initial screening
3- Potential changes to the resume that can help the candidate
4- Cover letter option for sending to the company to accompany the resume
